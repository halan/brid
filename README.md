#ABANDONED!

# Brid


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'brid'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install brid

Or if you want use Rails3 validations on ActiveModel, add this to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'brid-rails'
```

## Components

* CPF object with validation (brazilian document)
* CNPJ object with validation (brazilian document)
* TÃ­tulo de Eleitor object with validation (brazilian document)
* PIS object with validation (brazilian document)
* Cred Card object with validation (generic)
* Generic ID validation (can validate bank account and other things)
* Luhn algorithms modulus 10 and 11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm

## Usage

### Validating a CPF

``` ruby
CPF.new('135246876-01').valid?                     # true
CPF.new('135.246.876-01').valid?                   # true
CPF.new('13524687601').valid?                      # true
CPF.new(13524687601).valid?                        # true
(Mod11.new('135246876') * 2).to_s == '13524687601' # true
'135246876'.mod11(2)              == '13524687601' # true
```

### Validating a CNPJ

``` ruby
CNPJ.new('18.781.203/0001-28').valid?                                      # true
(Mod11.new('18.781.203/0001', :base => 2..9) * 2).to_s == '18781203000128' # true
'18.781.203/0001'.mod11(2, :base => 2..9)              == '18781203000128' # true

``` 
  
### Validating a Bank Account

``` ruby
GenericID.new('12345-5').valid?           # true
(Mod11.new('12345') * 1).to_s == '123455' # true
'12345'.mod11                 == '123455' # true

```

### Validating a Cred Card

``` ruby
CredCard.new('411119876333502').valid? # true
(Mod10.new('41111987633350') * 1).to_s == '411119876333502' # true
'41111987633350'.mod10                 == '411119876333502' # true
```


## Next Steps

* Develop a smart generator for fixture on tests (I thought of doing built on top of ffaker, like my other gem: [ffaker-cpfcnpj](https://github.com/halan/ffaker-cpfcnpj) )
